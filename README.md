performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
# Kickstarting with Excelr

## Overview of Project
Louise is a budding play writer and is trying to produce her new play "Fever." In order to finance her play, she has estimated that she needs over $10,000, and wants to start a 
crowdfunding campaign to help her generate the required funds. She is seeking our help to understand the trends from previous crowdfunding data to determine if she can jump into her crowdfunding campaign.
We are using the data from the crowdfunding website, from thousands of crowdfunding projects, to determine which trends and actions are more viable for Louise to persue.
To achieve this, we will be using Excel to to organize and sort a vast amount of data and determine those certain factors that makes a project campaign successful. The goal of this project is to help Louise succeed in her campaign by providing her 
ample and accurate data.

### Purpose
As mentioned above, the purpose of this project is to help Louise understand and determine a structured path for a successful crowdfunding campaing for her play "Fever." 

## Analysis and Challenges
The project is to use the vast amount of data, mined from the website, to help Louise figure out a plan to design and execute a successful campaign.
To achieve this, we are improting and analyzing various data intoa  table. We are applying different filters,
formats, and formulas to this data to get a clearer picture for Louise's campaign. We are also creating and interpreting data through the use of graphs and charts, which can simplify the understanding of the vast amount of data in single picture.
Although the vast amount of data can help, it can also create some challenges. We have to make sure that we are filtering the right category, which matches Louise's vision, to generate a specif plan.
Because there is a huge amount of data available, performing analysis on thousands of projects to uncover any hidden trends might be stressful.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
According to the analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date for theater, globally, May and June had the highest number of successful campaigns. Whereas, December was the most unsuccessful because less than 50% of the campaign were successful. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
According to the analysis based on Goals, the campaigns with goals of $25,000 to $35,000 and campaigns above $45,000 were had higher percentage of failure.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results
What are some limitations of this dataset?
Although there is a vast amount of data, i find the lack of demographic count as one of the limitation. I think it can be real helpful if there was a data that showed which demographic and age group supported which play. 
This could help Louise focus her campaign to the demographic that her play is designed for.

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We can create percentage funded vs goal graph. we can create table comparing different categories that shows which category has more successful campaigns.
